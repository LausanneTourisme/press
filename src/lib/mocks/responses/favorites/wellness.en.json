It runs alongside the lake between the magnificent lakeside houses and the small wild beaches. Following it, we arrive at St-Sulpice beach that has remained almost entirely wild. Between the forest and the long, white sandy beaches, this place will delight the adventurous souls who wish to get off the beaten tracks while remaining close to Lausanne.",
